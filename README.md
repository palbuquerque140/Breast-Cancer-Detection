# Breast Cancer Image Classification

## Overview 
---

This project develops deep learning models to classify breast cancer histopathological images from the BreakHis dataset (~7,900 images).
The goal is to first distinguish benign vs. malignant tumors (binary classification) and then identify tumor subtypes (multiclass classification), supporting diagnostic decision-making.
